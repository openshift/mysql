All shell scripts with extention .sh will be sourced and thus executed before
the first start of container (i.e. the container is started with empty data
directory).

At the time these scripts are executed, the daemon runs on localhost only.

In order to perform some action (for example creating new databases,
users or initialize the database according to your needs on the first start
of the container), put shell scripts with .sh extensios into this directory.
